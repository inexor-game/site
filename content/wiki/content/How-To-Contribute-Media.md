# How to contribute media

If you want to contribute content to Inexor, make sure to follow these rules:

## Licenses (important)

* Check our [list of accepted licenses](../License-Policy.html).
* Inexor is an 100% open source project! This includes the source code but also the media assets.
* You must submit your content under an open source license which is accepted by us.
* You must assign a license to your work. "Do whatever you want with it" is not a license.
* If you can't decide which license to use, choose [CC0 BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en).
* If you disagree with open source licenses, you cannot contribute to Inexor.
* If no license is provided, your content will be deleted.
* In case you uploaded the work of someone else but it does not have an open source license, the content will be deleted.

## Git for version control

* Inexor uses [Git version control system](https://git-scm.com/).
* If you are new to Git, try [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). It's easy to use.

## Security

* For media assets like models, textures or sounds, [signing commits](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work) is not required.
* If you want to contribute code, the commits must be [signed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work) for cryptographic security.

## File names

* All file names should be lower case (numbers and underscores allowed).

## Models

* Contribute models to Inexor's model repository.
* Use [glTF2](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) file format.
* Don't use obj, md3/md5 or iqm. Inexor does not support this!

## Textures

* Use [jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) or [png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) as file format.
* Textures must have a resolution of base 2, at least 512x512px, highly preferable is 1024x1024.
* Please notice that popular texture websites forbit to use their textures in open source projects.

## Sound/Music

* Use [flac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC) for recoding audio, but prefer [ogg vorbis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg) for inclusion ingame later.
* No lyrics in background music.
* Keep source files, like .flac, .blend, .xcf and so on. If you, we or anybody else want one day to edit our content these files are essential.
