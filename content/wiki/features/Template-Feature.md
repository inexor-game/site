# Feature Template

Use this template to create new features. Below you can find a fill-in-the-gaps checklist to make sure you create a well established concept.
This section of your feature should contain a quick overview in 1-2 sentences, what it is about. In the title, put the name of your feature.
Although, the sections below are not mandatory, they serve as a skeleton to organize your content.

## Development:

**Option a)** Full development with live reload

1. [Fork the wiki](https://github.com/inexorgame/site/)
2. Clone to your desktop
3. If not installed: [get NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
4. In the repo, run `npm i`
5. To start developing: `npm run dev` - this will spin up a local dev server on port 8080
6. Copy the feature and start writing

**Option b)** Just text editing

We are using Netlify as our host. Netlify offers pull-request and branch based preview renders. For a  PR, you can edit the page on Github directly. Every page has an "improve this page" link embedded at the bottom.
Just add `WIP` to your PRs title, as long as you are authoring new content to see new previews.

::: tip

If you need more than one page to describe your feature, you can create a folder instead and place a `index.md` in there. Pages there are listed as related in the top of the page.
Extra pages shouldn't be marked as "layout: feature" then.
