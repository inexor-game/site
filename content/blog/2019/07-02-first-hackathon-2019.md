summary:    Announcement of the first 2019 Hackathon
---

A wise man (guess who?) once said: _"Freiburg has some really nice people and good beer, we should host a Hackathon there"._

This is why we will finally have our first Hackathon in Freiburg. The [CCCFR](https://www.cccfr.de/) is kindly hosting us at [their local Hackspace](https://www.cccfr.de/treff/).

We will sleep at [Blackforest Hostel](https://blackforest-hostel.de), where we have made reservation for everyone who signed up! If you need a place to sleep, either talk with @Fohlen, or book a bed there directly!

Here is a nice flyer made by @IAmNotHanni, which sums it up pretty good:
