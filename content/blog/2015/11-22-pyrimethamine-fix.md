## Pyrimethamine - Alpha 0.4.1
Since there have been a bunch of issues with the current Pyrimethamine Edition, our team decided to release a fix version to address them.

*Alpha 0.4.1* brings along the following enhancements

- Fixes crash when you use *subsystem_start* within one of your config(s)
- Fixes a bug which could lead to a crash due to explosions
- CEF is now packaged and installed accordingly
- Repairs various functions that would try to load non-existent files (such as */getmap*)
