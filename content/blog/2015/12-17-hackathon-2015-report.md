## Hackathon 2015 - report
An entire weekend went past, and we didn't share anything with you. **That's rough, isn't it?**

*So, what happened [at the Hackathon](/blog/2015/11-22-hackathon-stuttgart)? What decisions did we make? What funny moments stayed in our memory?*

We will try to summarize that quickly.

#### Acknowledgment to the shackspace
We would like to shout out a big thank you to shackspace.

Without you guys, this meeting probably wouldn't have been possible, and the room and people created an atmosphere that was almost magic, literally inviting anyone to work on our project.

#### Public awareness
Another point that we're very happy with is the audience of local hackers who discovered us via [the shackspace blog (German)](http://shackspace.de/?p=5228).

Unfortunately nobody brought a camera along for the presentation, which is why we can only [share the slides with you](https://inexorgame.github.io/blog-media/2015/12/slides-hackathon2015.html).

#### Simplify things
A problem that has often occurred to us, is a growing complexity in issue trackers and wiki organization.

Having different sources for different projects is just fine, although this might utterly confuse strangers from outside.

Because of that reason, we decided to simplify our wikis and issues. The central repository to file any bug or suggestion is now [inexorgame/code](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core)

Furthermore we decided to force our *Code of Conduct* for **contributions** *as well as* **the IRC channel**.

#### Awesome new technologies
I'm very briefly going to talk about this one. As we've discussed hundred of visionary features, this roughly cuts the edge

* [a 3D visual scripting engine](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/tree/hanni/3DVisualScripting)
* [Inexor Tree API](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/wiki/Inexor-Tree-API)
* [Version Control System for maps](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/wiki/Version-Control-System)
* a [better map format](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/wiki/Blueprint-Extendable-map-format)
* [refactored source structure](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/pull/249)
* [speed up the AppVeyor build process enormously](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/pull/252)
* [Merged all the latest stuff from Sauerbraten](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/pull/252)
* added a fix so Inexor [can compile with recent GCC 5.3](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/pull/253), [and newer libCEF branches](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/issues/271)


#### post scriptum
Thanks everyone for the enjoyable weekend. It has shown us once again that a philosophy of open-minded development leads towards the best team atmosphere one can imagining.

We have came across a funny new motto: [**"Use the fork Luke!"**](https://octodex.github.com/images/octobiwan.jpg)

If you are re wondering what a *fork-drink* would look like, [here is the answer](https://inexorgame.github.io/blog-media/2015/12/forkdrink.jpg).
