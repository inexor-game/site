#### Spread the word
Tell your neighbor, your coworker, your fellow student - everyone who could be interested in an uprising new open-source FPS.

Additionally, we **encourage** any re-posting on mailing lists or related blogs.
####I've got a question left - who to talk to?
Firstly consider our [internal pad](https://pad.inexor.org/p/Hackathon_2015), which gives a deeper insight into the event.
*a_teammate* and *Fohlen* manage the event, either drop them a mail *@inexor.org* or contact us on IRC.

**Last but not least**, we're as excited about the Hackathon as you are - see you in December!
