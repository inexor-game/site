## Aquarust Edition
Dear all,

The Inexor team released the next Alpha of Inexor (0.3) so called __"Aquarust"__ Edition.
Although this is yet another minor release, focusing on code refactors, we have also included a few new maps and reintroduced the server browser.

For a full list of features check the [release on GitHub](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/releases/tag/0.3.0-alpha).
If you're curious what has changed under the hood, have a look at this pad about [Alpha 0.3 design decisions](https://pad.inexor.org/p/Alpha3_Design_Decisions).

### Something doesn't work. What to do?
Don't panic. This is still pre-release software, and there are a few bugs known.

1. You can always try to grab the latest build from our [nightly archive](http://nightly.inexor.org).
2. Furthermore, if you are on Ubuntu, you should check out [this bug](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/issues/209).
3. If you encounter any strange errors, let us know in [our forum](https://community.inexor.org), on [GitHub](https://github.com/inexorgame), or @ _#Inexor_

### What's next on the list?
There's dozens of things to do, but there are a few preferences set:

* Round up all the fixes and cleanups we started. Have a look at our [bug-tracker](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/issues)!
* Deliver native Linux builds for major distributions and cross-compiled binaries for OS X.
* Get CEF to run properly and design a GUI with it!
* Enhance the RPC so we're able to script Inexor with ease.
* Establish a way to send maps, configs, textures (...), together with a slightly new map format.
* [Write a new master server](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/issues/20) and get it running.

If you feel like any of these match your skills, don't hesitate to join our forces!
