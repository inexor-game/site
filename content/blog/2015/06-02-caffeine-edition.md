Hello there. Finally the time has come to release the first alpha of Inexor.

### What's new?
This very first release, so called _"Caffeine"_ Edition is targeted at developers and brings a whole bunch of new technology into the game.
Head over the [changelog](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/releases/tag/v0.1-alpha) for a full list of features. If you're interested in the tech stuff, read a_teammate's post about [*design decisions*](https://inexor.org/blog/2015/04-26-alpha1-design-decisions).

### Download
Although this not a *consumer-ready* product yet you can obtain a bundle packaged *"to-go"* from [GitHub](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/releases/tag/v0.1-alpha).

### Feedback
We would be glad to receive as much feedback as possible. [Submit](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/issues) issues, bugs, ideas (...).
